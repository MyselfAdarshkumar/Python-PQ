# Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user

# Take two integer inputs
num1 = int(input("Enter your first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter your second number: "))

# Calculate the average using normal division
average = (num1 + num2) / 2

# Display the result
print("Average =", average)
